# lua_suspend

Suspend function for Lua.

The suspend function is extracted from sleep function on [luasocket](https://github.com/diegonehab/luasocket).
The idea is based on [lua_sleep](https://github.com/darkstalker/lua_sleep) proyect.

## Goal

Many people add [luasocket](https://github.com/diegonehab/luasocket) to their scripts,
to use __sleep__ function. This library, only has that function.

## Instalation

### Rocks

```
# luarocks install --server=https://luarocks.org/dev suspend
```

### Building

```
git clone https://github.com/1nv1/lua_suspend
cd lua_suspend
make && make install
```

## Example

```lua
local suspend = require("suspend")
suspend(2.5) -- Sleep for two and half seconds
```
